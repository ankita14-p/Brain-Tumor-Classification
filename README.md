🧠 Brain Tumor Multi-Class Classification

Project Overview

This project performs multi-class brain tumor detection from MRI scans using deep learning and transfer learning. The model classifies MRI images into four categories:

🟢 Glioma

🔵 Meningioma

⚪ No Tumor

🟣 Pituitary Tumor


Using VGG-16 with transfer learning, the model provides accurate predictions, supporting early diagnosis and better treatment planning.
